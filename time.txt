Biggest challenge: Understanding XArray implmenetation on the kernel level. 
Most interesting discoveryHonestly I think one of the best value things I got from this exercise was seeing /proc/filename working in real time. This honestly helped lessen 
the abstraction of the VFS and the levels of kernel calls to read from this file.
